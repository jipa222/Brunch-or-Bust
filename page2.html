  <p>Chef and owner Jianna Palania has a devout love of breakfast food,</p>
  <p>yet is physically incapable of waking up before 12:00pm.</p>
  <p>With 10 years of kitchen experience in some of America's most prestigious restaurants</p>
  <p>and a fiery determination to eat breakfast food regardless of the time of day,</p>
  <p>the concept of Brunch or Bust was born.</p>
